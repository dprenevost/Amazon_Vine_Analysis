# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: i used this data to find out if there was any difference between Vine reviews, paid reveiws or Non Vine unpaid reviews of musical instruments.

Results: 

Here are the total number of products with more than 20 reviews, this combines both paid and unpaid.
* We limited the number to more than 20 to get a better sense and statistically significant measures for our project.

Summary: In summation, with the data provided, I cannot see any significant bias in either direction. The paid reviews and the unpaid reviews have the same % of 5 star reviews.

One additional measure would be to compare and contrast the other reviews from 0 to 4 stars to see if there was any further variation between the 2.  Additional paid reviews would also be better for the analysis.
